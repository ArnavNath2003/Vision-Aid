# VisionAid Project Development Prompt

## Goal
Create a React-based web application for an urban infrastructure management platform called VisionAid, focusing on intelligent, futuristic design and interactive user experience.

## Project Requirements
1. Develop a single-page React application
2. Implement a 3D background using Three.js
3. Create an interactive, responsive design
4. Include day/night mode toggle
5. Design two main project sections with detailed modals

## Detailed Context
